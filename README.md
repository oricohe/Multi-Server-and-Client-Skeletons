## Server
The server is based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and can serve several clients at the same time. The code (server_skeleton.py) already has an functions like singup, login, logut and so.
	
## Client
The client is based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). And like the server, the code (client_skeleton.py) also has functions that are already established
	
## Installation
Program is written ins Python 3.x. Here is the easy process to download
```
$ git clone https://github.com/oricohe/Multi-Server-and-Client-Skeletons
```
Now we can run the server
```
$ cd Multi-Server-and-Client-Skeletons
$ python3 server_skeleton.py
```
And Now you can run the clien (on a different cmd)
```
$ cd Multi-Server-and-Client-Skeletons
$ python3 client_skeleton.py
```
You can run how many clients you want

All you have to do is add functions according to your needs. Hope I helped, good luck.
